Hi, my name is Ivan.

- I started my career in 2007 as a freelancer in web development.
- I’ve worked in various settings: in-office and remotely, for on-site and overseas customers, for large established companies as well as small, fast-paced startups.
- I've been working remotely since 2015.
- Over the years, I’ve transitioned through roles as a web developer, software engineer, and currently work as a tech lead.
- Languages spoken:
  - English
  - Ukrainian
  - Polish 
  - Russian 
  - German - Guten Tag! Ich habe keine Ahnung. Auf Wiedersehen! (That’s about the extent of my German.)
